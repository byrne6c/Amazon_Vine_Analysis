## Summary: 

Within the data I choose & the results comparing 5-star & 4-star paid/non-paying reviewers, there is no positivity bias suspected because less than 1% of both 5-star & 4-star reviews are paid reviewers. 
Both 5 & 4 star ratings account for 75% of the entire ratings data.

Personally, as a gamer myself, I would be curious about performing a an anylsis on the comments section of the review as well as the ratio between "helpful votes" with a high count versus a low count. Helpful feedback data to others could show us patterns that may relate to potentially bias reviews.
